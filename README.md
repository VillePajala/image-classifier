# Simple image classifier
A simple AI project for rehearsing building neural networks


## Project steps:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Initialize the project with a README and .gitignore file for Python.
   - Set up a virtual environment for the project (using `venv` or `conda`).

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create `requirements.txt` for project dependencies (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`/`keras` or `pytorch`, etc.).

3. **Data Collection**
   - Decide on a dataset to use (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
   - Download and store the data in a structured directory within the project.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and split into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing steps like normalization, resizing, augmentation, etc.

5. **Model Design**
   - Create a new Python script or Jupyter notebook for building the model.
   - Define the model architecture (start with a simple CNN with a few layers).

6. **Training**
   - Write code to train the model on the training set.
   - Implement callbacks for monitoring progress, saving checkpoints, and early stopping if needed.

7. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set during training.
   - After training, evaluate the model on the test set and report metrics such as accuracy.

8. **Improvement**
   - Based on the model's performance, consider changes to the model's architecture or hyperparameters.
   - Re-train and evaluate the model after each set of changes.

9. **Documentation**
   - Document the process, results, and any findings in the README.
   - Include comments in the scripts to explain the code and logic.

10. **Version Control**
    - Commit changes regularly with clear, descriptive commit messages.
    - Push the commits to the GitHub repository.

11. **Packaging (Optional)**
    - If the project will be used more widely, consider packaging it as a Python package with a `setup.py` file.

12. **Deployment (Optional)**
    - If the model will be deployed (e.g., as a web app), plan for deployment using tools like Flask, Docker, or a cloud service.

13. **Project Review and Refinement**
    - Review the project to identify any possible refinements or additional features.
    - Refactor the code to improve quality and maintainability.

Remember, this is a basic outline, and your project might require additional or fewer steps based on its specifics. As you gain experience, you'll be able to tailor this outline to better fit your workflow and the complexity of the projects you tackle.
